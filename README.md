# paysbuy-php
A simple PHP wrapper for these APIs:
* **Paynow** at `https://www.paysbuy.com/api_paynow/api_paynow.asmx` - documentation is [here](https://docs.paysbuy.com/#authentication-amp-verification)
* **GetTransaction** at `https://www.paysbuy.com/psb_ws/getTransaction.asmx` - documentation is [here](https://docs.paysbuy.com/#paynow-results-not-received)

## * _IMPORTANT Announcement_ *

PAYSBUY has been acquired by [Omise](http://omise.co). As a result of this, PAYSBUY's online payment services will eventually be shutting down. Merchants should be contacted regarding migration to Omise's online payment services.

Omise has a PHP library for its payment services [here](https://github.com/omise/omise-php), but it is important to note that it is unlikely to be compatible with your existing code that uses the Paysbuy library.

Please direct further questions to the Omise [forum](http://forum.omise.com) or [support@omise.co](mailto:support@omise.co)
